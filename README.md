# LIRI-BOT
LIRI-Bot (Node.js)
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

How it Works
LIRI is a command line node app that takes four commands:
concert-this
spotify-this-song
movie-this
do-what-it-says

Format: ![alt text](C:\Users\guayo\Documents\images\lirib.png "image of my app working");
